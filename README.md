# MotionSensingFlyTrap

## Description 

This is an Arduino sketch for a motion sensing fly trap.
by Matt Nutsch

## Components

Components/tools needed to build the device:
- 1 ESP8266 microcontroller
- 1 HC-SR501 PIR Motion Sensor
- 1 SG90 Micro Servo
- 1 Micro-USB power cable with wall adapter
- 6 Male to Male Dupont electrical wires
- 1 mini breadboard
- 1 Glass Jar
- Cardboard
- Scissors
- Tape

## Installation:

1. Install the Arduino IDE on your computer
2. In the Arduino IDE Preferences, add the ESP8266 Board Manager URL under Additional Boards Manager URLs: http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json
3. Add the ESP8266 board in the Arduino Board Manager
4. Install the Servo library in the Arduino Library Manager (if not already installed)
5. Open the file MotionSensingFlyTrap.ino in the Arduino IDE
6. Connect your ESP8266 microcontroller to your computer with the cable.
7. Flash the project to the ESP8266
8. Insert the ESP8266 into the mini breadboard
9. Connect the HC-SR501 PIR Motion Sensor and SG90 Micro Servo to your ESP8266 using the Male to Male Dupont electrical wires
10. Cut the mounts and a lid out of cardboard
11. Mount the breadboard, motion sensor, servo and lid on the jar
12. Plug the device in using the micro-USB cable
